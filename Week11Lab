Data <-> Model Correspondence

Clustering
Unsupervised = Data is not labeled

Overview:
-	When you are trying to learn about something, say music, one approach might be to look for meaningful groups or collections. 
-	Want to group unlabeled examples into clusters

When to use:
-	Large, unstructured data
-	When you don’t know how many or which classes your data is divided into 
-	When manually dividing and annotating your data is too resource-intensive
-	When you’re looking for anomalies in your data 

Helps to:
-	Segment rows (customers, people, etc.)
-	Help to structure your data 

Common Applications:
-	Market segmentation
-	Search result grouping
-	Image segmentation
-	Anomaly detection
Examples of Clustering:
-	Group stars by brightness.
-	Group organisms by genetic information into a taxonomy.
-	Group documents by topic.
Types of Clustering
1)	Centroid-based clustering (K-means)
2)	Density-based clustering 
3)	Distribution-based clustering 
4)	Hierarchical Clustering (trees)
Type of Data 
-	For Data with Continuous Variables:
o	Normalize data (z-scores)
   Well-suited for data that is normally distributed
o	Log Transformation 
  	Well-suited for data that clumps at the low end 
o	Quantiles
  	Most other times, no clear distribution

-	For Mixed Data (Continuous & Categorical):
o	Only use continuous features (remove categorical data)
o	Numerically encode the categorical data (taken = 1, single = 0)

Classification/Regression
Supervised = data has labels 

Overview: 
-	When you have labeled data that you want to predict something 
-	Classification 
o	Used to predict/classify discrete values (i.e. males, females, true, false, et,)
-	Regression
o	Used to predict continuous values (price, salary, age, etc.)
